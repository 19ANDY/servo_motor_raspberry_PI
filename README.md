# servo_motor_raspberry_PI
The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It does not include peripherals (such as keyboards, mice and cases). However, some accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.

According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, over 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold by February 2015, making it the best-selling British computer. By November 2016 they had sold 11 million units, and 12.5m by March 2017, making it th1e third best-selling "general purpose computer". In July 2017, sales reached nearly 15 million. In March 2018, sales reached 19 million.

They are made in a Sony factory in Pencoed, Wales.

Basically, i have used the raspberry pi with the servo motor for this desinger project. This was the project from the kasa studio and i have got this project during my internship. In this project we have to move the metal plates according to the movement of the coustomer (as they enters the shop), the plates would move accordingly.
